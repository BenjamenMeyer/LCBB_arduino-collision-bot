The collision-bot workshop steps you through building a foam board, arduino based collision-avoidance bot. See PDF instruction and code.  You can buy all the parts off Amazon or AliExpress.com for around $30. Here's the parts list you:
Arduino (brain, 1x) - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01E8LKITO/ ($10)
Ultrasonic US-100 (eyes, 1x) - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009URKD2E ($4)
KY-008 Laser - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07216CZTV/  (<$5)
Servos (x2) - https://www.robotshop.com/en/9g-continuous-rotation-micro-servo.html ($10)
9V Battery Case - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06WGQKJ5P ($5)
9V Battery (~$2)

The Laser-Bot Mission to Mars uses the collision-bot chassis, add a laser diode to make a mission to marse lab where the student has to program the laser-bot rover to it's target and blast the alien ship.


Collision-Bot Workshop:
To get started..

1- download the PDF instrtuctions and build the bot (requires 5"x6" foam board, 2 milk jug caps, 1 soda cap, arduino, two continuous servos and a US-100 ping sensor and hto glue.)

2 - download ping_US-100_sensor.ino fist.. build/upload and THEN hook up the US-100 ping sensor (do not connect ping sensor until you have uploaded/run the code!)

3 - download the two-servo-test.ino sevo motor test code and tune forwardL, forwardR, stopL and stopR values for straight movement and solid stopping

4 - combine ping and sevo code to make autonomous bot

You should be able to code your very own collision-avoidance bot.
