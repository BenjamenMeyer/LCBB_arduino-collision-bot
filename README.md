This is the code for the Let's Code Blacksburg Arduino, Sensors, Robotics Workshop
https://www.eventbrite.com/e/16123723491 

It's for building a foam board, arduino based collision-avoidance bot. See documentation in code.

To get started..
1 - download ping_US-100_sensor.ino fist.. build/upload and THEN hook up the US-100 ping sensor
2 - download the two-servo-test.ino sevo motor test code next

Between those two, you should be able to code your very own collision-avoidance bot.  If you want to see a more complete version, check out the LCBB_collision-bot_complete.ino code.
